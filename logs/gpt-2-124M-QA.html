        Model prompt >>> What are you?
        ======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
         (Duck).
        
        What are you doing? (Duck).
        
        Oh, that was one of those things that I just went and asked myself. I think there's a lot of other people out there who have this, you know, one thing they're doing better now; they're better. You know, you've seen it. We're in the NFL. I've been on the field before. I've been involved with the team when I could, you know, go, "Wow. That's really good work out there."
        
        But yeah, it's good to be out there and that's what makes you so good; it helps you in a lot of ways. The thing that I noticed at every corner you're coming out, is that if you give guys opportunities, they feel comfortable with it.
        
        When I started, when I thought I was going to play, everybody just kind of stopped. I think that changed over the course of your career if you're successful. You know, people, guys like Tim Welker, the way you approach your offense and how you keep it organized. The way you run your personnel staff, the way you move the team.
        
        Yeah, you know, I mean what's the problem? What's the opportunity?
        
        So I think we're just not getting any better.
        
        Really?
        
        That's just a good thing. You know, I mean as I pointed out, for some guys, it takes so much time to develop, sometimes it takes so long to grow.
        
        You know, some guys, even just as I showed you, the coaching staff has to be on your side, because you're not getting good.
        
        And you're not getting the best at what you need. You're not getting the best that you're ever getting, and I mean obviously, you have to put your body on edge and be that guy, where all the time it's so hard to get better. It's not so hard for you, it's not all the time.
        
        That's just to be like, I would rather it be that way right now, than in the future.
        
        It's not what you got now, and I really like the philosophy and the way you operate. But I think in all our games, we have to put our body on edge and be ready for the next guy, when they've got a chance here. You always have to play the game so you can handle,

        Model prompt >>> What is the meaning of life?
        ======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
        
        
        If you've ever used a piece of music you can understand what is meant by that music. It is an essential meaning in music and it is vital to a piece of music. A piece is a symbol or concept.
        
        There is no other meaning of life besides being alive if you like it. Therefore, if you can say that life is meaning, then you should say that life is life.
        
        What is your meaning to life?
        
        If we have lived with a piece of music, our goal is to live with it for a lifetime. If we do not have the time, we might lose our memories and lose our connection with this piece.
        
        I know that life is very important. Life is vital to you and your life, you will always feel it. You have all these things that you are trying to live for.
        
        I know that living with a piece of music, life that you are trying to live for is very difficult but it is what you deserve to be happy for. This is why I choose to have an important piece of music.
        
        That is why if anyone wants me to listen to it, then I will listen to the music. This means that I get to listen to it because this piece is important for us, which is why I choose this piece of music.
        
        The piece is the life that we live in but the music that we choose to leave it, so to speak.
        
        I will also hear you saying, if I love you, I will listen and feel a certain love for you, but I will leave this piece of music to you and your life will become less important than you think it is to me.
        
        A piece of music, to me, is the life that we live in. It must give you a meaningful outlet and a way to express yourself. It is for this piece of music that I want that life be meaningful to me. A piece of music that makes you want to live for this piece of music.
        
        It would be nice to have that life.
        
        Do not just listen to the music, but read the written content. Do not wait for that piece of music. Even if it doesn't give you an authentic feeling for life, you should read it and then experience it yourself.
        
        Life isn't something you buy or buy things from, but the material means you feel for it. If you take care of it yourself, then it's worth investing you money in it.

        Model prompt >>> Is life precious?
        ======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================
         Does all life come from God?" (Hebrews 11:24)
        
        The following is one of the many scriptures of the LDS church to be found by Latter-day Saints in my home at the Salt Lake Temple. I would like to include a few of them.
        
        1. God created mankind; and that He created him; and to His glory they gave him life. The scriptures record that God created Adam, Eve, and every other creature in heaven and on earth and even the sea. But man did not produce these creatures by his own will alone. Adam made the first humans, and these creatures became men and women through the sexual union of their minds, heart and hands. God made each of the creatures to be men and women "in the midst of their flesh;" (Acts 1:29–32) and to be men, and to be women—this being was the reason why man should not be created. (Acts 8:28–29) There is a great discrepancy between what's reported from Genesis 1:19 and what is written in the Book of Mormon in the Pearl of Great Price. In Genesis 1:19 the Lord revealed that every creature male and female was created in a natural way for the purpose of perpetuating his or her name. It says that man had sex with a woman before he became a man in the flesh, but was created to take his name by his love toward her; hence it says that man is the one creation. "I tell you, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall establish the earth on the face of the Earth, both female and male, as His own; and the earth upon the face of the Earth shall bear all these things which He has revealed on the face of the Father (D&C 37:1–10), but on the side which shall never be known." (Hebrews 11:27)
        
        2. God created men and women by His own desire and pleasure in themselves. This definition of sexuality includes both male and female, and is what I find most pertinent to the topic of "God's creation of man and woman." I think it is a good point to draw in your mind to the statement that this definition "will bring God to His glory." Again, this is true. God did not create any man and woman in the universe. It is what we have been told throughout the scriptures to think. You need a certain level of understanding to understand this. It does not mean that we should be
